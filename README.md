# Beck-ATM-Sim

# Description
This simple ATM application GUI I developed using Java allows users to create an account with access to withdraws, deposits, transfers, and past transactions. Users also have the ability to login and logout. Popup windows display for all successful and failed features like deposits, logins, account registration etc. This project was created entirely with the Java Development Kit JDK18 and MySQL as the database. 

# Necessary imports to use this product

This project was developed on IntelliJ and is recommended to be used to run this application.
